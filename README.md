# CatQuest

## Description

CatQuest is an HTML mini game where the user will battle or try to escape from cat enemies.<br>
The story will change as the user keeps clicking buttons and taking damage from random cat images. <br>
This project helped us work as a team to create a webpage from zero using HTML, CSS and JavaScript language. <br>
We chose to make a mini game to solve boredom while applying HTML, CSS and JavaScript concepts learned in the last 6 weeks.
